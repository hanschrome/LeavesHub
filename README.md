# [Doc] LeavesHub - Forests of knowledge

Documentation project of LeavesHub

![Forests explained](https://github.com/hanschrome/LeavesHub/raw/main/docs/forest/media/Schema.png)

## What is LeavesHub

LeavesHub is a platform to manage and structure *content*.

To do so, the content is structured from **Leaves**, that usually is a short content or a link. So users can share between
them different Leaves. A Leave is just a unit of content. For example, a YouTube video of muffin recipe.

To organize Leaves, there are **Branches**. A Branch is a thing that typically you can do, and they typically start by
a verb. A synonym of Branch, could be Skill. For example, "To cook muffins".

To organize Branches, there are **Trees**. A Tree is a set of rules or norms whose compliance consistently leads to a
certain result. A synonym of Tree, would be Discipline. For example, "Cooking desserts".

To organize Trees, there are **Forests**. A Forest is the space and set of things in which a person develops. A Synonym of
Forest, would be Ambit. For example, "Cooking".

So a Forest is a collection of Trees, A Tree is a collection of Branches, and a Branch is a collection of Leaves.
